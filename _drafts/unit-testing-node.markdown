### Mocha and Chai

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

>Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.

[Chai](http://chaijs.com/)

> Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

```bash
npm install -g mocha chai
```
