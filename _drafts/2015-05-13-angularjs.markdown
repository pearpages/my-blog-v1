# AngularJS

Javascript client-side frameworks are sustainable models that offer many advantages over conventional web frameworks, such as simplicity, rapid development, speed of operation, testability, and the ability to package the entire application and deploy it to all movile devices and the Web with relative ease.

## MVC

AngularJS uses the MVC design pattern and embraces that pattern completely. The model, view, and controller are all clearly defined in AngularJS.

## RESTful web services

AngularJS's **resource** object lets developers interact with  REST services like standard objects.

AngularJS services help to greatly simplify an application by compartmentalizing client-side logic into single units of code.
