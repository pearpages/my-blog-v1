title:  "Javascript Regular Expressions"
---

Javascript regular expressions features were borrowed from Perl.

It is necessary to ahve a fairly complete understanding of the full complexity of regular expressions to correctly read them.

Methods:
* regexp.exec
* regexp.test
* string.match
* string.replace
* string.search
* strling.split

var parse_url = /^(?:[A-Za-z]+):)?$/;
