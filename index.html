				<h2>Why Programming?</h2>
<p>Programming is the art of telling a computer what to do through a set of instructions. Those instructions are written in a computer’s language, or code. We use computers all the time—even turning off the alarm clock or texting a friend. Becoming a programmer is one of the best ways to have an impact on the world because you can influence so many people’s lives with the things you make.</p>
