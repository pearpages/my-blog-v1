A function encloses a set of statements. Functions are the fundamental modular unit of JavaScript.

They are used for:

* Code reuse
* Information hiding
* Composition
* Behavior of objects

## Function Objects

Functions in javascript are objects.

Functions objects are linked to *Function.prototype* which itself linked to *Object.prototype*.

Every function is also created with two additional hidden properties: 
* the function's context
* the code that implements the function's behavior

The thing that is special about functions is that they can be invoked.

## Function Literal

A function literal has four parts:

* word *function*
* name or *anonymous*
* set of parameters
* set of statements

```javascript
function optionalNameOfTheFunction(param1, param2){
 //statements 
}
```

An inner function also enjoys access to the parameters and variables of the functions it is nested within. The function object created by a function literal contains **a link to that outer context**. This is called *closure*.

## Invocation

Every function receives two additional parameters: **this** and **arguments**.

The **this** parameter is very important in object oriented programming, and its value is determined by the *invocation pattern*.

There are four patterns of invocation in Javascript. The patterns differ in how the bonus parameter **this** is initialized:

* method invocation pattern
* function invocation pattern
* constructor invocation pattern
* apply invocation pattern

### The Method Invocation Pattern

When a function is stored as a property of an object, we call it *method*.

```javascript
var myObject = {
        value:0,
        increment: function(inc){
                this.value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
        }
};
 myObject.increment(); //1
 myObject.increment(3); //4
```

The binding of this to the object happens at **invocation time**.

Methods that get their object context from this are called *pubic methods*.

### The Function Invocation Pattern

When a function is invoked with this pattern, **this** is bound to the global object.

```javascript
function add(param1, param2){
        return param1 + param2;
}

var sum = add(3,6); //9
```

A consequence of this error is that a method cannot employ an inner function to help it do its work because the inner function does not share the method's acceses to the object as it its **this** is bound to the wrong value.

By convention, we use **that**

```javascript
//no problem with this
var myObject = {
        value:2,
        getValue : function (){
                return this.value;
        }
};
//augment myObject
//because it isn't part of the object we have to use that
myObject.double = function (){
        var that = this;

        var helper = function (){
                that.value = that.value + that.value;
        }

        helper();
};
myObject.double();
console.log(myObject.getValue()); //4
```

### The Constructor Invocation Pattern

Objects can inherit properties directly from other objects. The language is **class-free**.

If a function is invoked with the **new** prefix, then a new object will be created with a hidden link to the value of the function's *prototype* member, and *this* will be bound to that new object.

```javascript
var Quo = function (string){
        this.status = string;
}

Quo.prototype.getStatus = function (){
        return this.status;
};

var myQuo = new Quo("confused");
var myOtherQuo = new Quo("more confused");

console.log(myQuo.getStatus());
console.log(myOtherQuo.getStatus());
```

Functions that are intended to be used with the **new** prefix are called **constructors**. By convention, they are kept in variables with **capitalized** name.

### The Apply Invocation Pattern

Javascript is a **functional** object-oriented language, functions can have methods.

#### The Apply Method

It lets us construct an array of arguments to sue to invoke a function. It also lets us choose the value of *this*.

The first parameter is the value of *this* the second are the arguments.

```javascript
function add (param1,param2){
        return param1 + param2;
}

var array = [3,4];
var sum = add.apply(null,array); //sum is 7

```

```javascript
var Quo = function (string){
        this.status = string;
}

Quo.prototype.getStatus = function (){
        return this.status;
};

var statusObject = {
        status : 'OK'
};

var status = Quo.prototype.getStatus.apply(statusObject); // 'OK'


```

## Arguments

A bonus parameter that is available to functions when they are invoked is the *arguments* array (in fact it is an array-like object, it lacks all of the array  methods but length).
```javascript

var sum = function (){
        var i, sum 0;
        for(i=0; i < arguments.length; i += 1){
                sum += arguments[i];
        }
        return sum;
};

console.log(sum(4,8,15,16,23,42)); //108
```

## Return

A function always returns a value. If the *return* value is not specified, the *undefined* is returned.

If the function was invoked with the new prefix and the return value is not an object,
then this (the new object) is returned instead.

## Exceptions

```javascript
var add = function (a, b) {
        if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
                throw {
                        name: 'TypeError',
                        message: 'add needs numbers'
                };
        }
        return a + b;
}

var try_it = function ( ) {
        try {
                add("seven");
        } catch (e) {
                document.writeln(e.name + ': ' + e.message);
        }
}

try_it( );

```

## Augmenting Types

JavaScript allows the basic types of the language to be augmented. This also works for functions, arrays, strings, numbers, regular expressions, and booleans.

By augmenting the basic types, we can make significant improvements to the expressiveness of the language. Because of the dynamic nature of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance, all values are immediately endowed with the new methods, even values that were created before the methods were created.

One defensive technique is to add a method only if the method is known to be missing:
```javascript
        // Add a method conditionally.
        Function.prototype.method = function (name, func) {
                if (!this.prototype[name]) {
                        this.prototype[name] = func;
                }
        };
```

## Recursion

A *recursive* function is a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly.

## Scope

> *Scope* in a programming language controls the visibility and lifetimes of variables and parameters.

> Javascript does not have block scope, but does have function scope.

In javascript it is best to declare all of the variables used in a function at the top of the function body.

## Closure

Inner functions get access to the parameters and variables of the functions they are defined within (with the eception of *this* and *arguments*).

In the following example we are not assigning a function, we are assigning the result of invoking that function. The inner function has a longer lifetime than its outer function.  *Value* variable is always available to *increment* and *getValue* methods, but the function's scope keeps it hidden from the rest of the program.

```javascript
//We are not assigining a function to *myObject*. We are assigning the result of invoking that function
var myObject = function (){
        var value = 0;

        return {
                increment: function (inc){
                        value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc: 1;
                },
                getValue: function (){
                        return value;
                }
        };
}();
```

The function returns an object containing two methods, and those methods continue to enjoy the privilege of access to the value variable.

## Callbacks

We pass a function parameter to the send_request_asynchronously function that will be called when the response is available.

```javascript
request = prepare_the_request( );
send_request_asynchronously(request, function (response) {
        display(response);
});
```

## Module

We can use functions and closure to make modules.

By using functions to produce modules, we can almost completely eliminate our use of global variables,
thereby mitigating one of JavaScriptâ€™s worst features.

> A module is a function or object that presents an interface but that hides its state and implementation.

The module pattern takes advantage of function scope and closure to create relationships that are binding and private.

## Cascade

It is typical for methods that set or change the state of an object to return nothing. If we have those methods return this instead of undefined, we can enable cascades.

## Curry

Currying allows us to produce a new function by combining a function and an argument.

## Memoization

Functions can use objects to remember the results of previous operations, making it possible to avoid unnecessary work.
