## What is it?

>A platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build and run applications entirely in the cloud.

## Deploy the app

I am going to create an app. I use my nickname as a namespace.

{% highlight bash %}
#create remote
heroku create pearpages-test-app
#deploy the code, same code for pushing changes
git push heroku master
{% endhighlight %}

## Run and instance and open it

{% highlight  bash %}
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku open
#view logs
heroku logs
{% endhighlight %}

## Define a Procfile

> Use a Procfile, a text file in the root directory of your application, to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start your app.

{% highlight  bash %}
web: node index.js
{% endhighlight %}

> This declares a single process type, **web**, and the command needed to run it.

## Run the app locally

{% highlight  bash %}
foreman start web
{% endhighlight %}

> Just like Heroku, Foreman examines the **Procfile** to determine what to run.

## Start a console

When the console starts, it has nothing loaded other than the *Nodee.js* standard library. From here you can ```require``` some of your application files.

{% highlight  bash %}
heroku run node
{% endhighlight %}
