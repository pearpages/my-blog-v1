Directives are what sets AngularJS apart form Javascript client-side frameworks.

Examples of directives are *ngModel*, *ngView* or *ngRepeat*.

## "Compiling"

AngularJS searches through the DOM tree to identify HTML elements associated with directives. The compiler then builds the template and assigns events to the associated elements in the template.
