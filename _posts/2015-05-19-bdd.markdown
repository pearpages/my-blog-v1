BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) is a synthesis and refinement of practices stemming from TDD (Test Driven Development) and ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development).

BDD augments TDD and ATDD with the following tactics:
* apply the "Five Why's" principle to each proposed User Story, so that its purpose is clearly related to business outcomes
* thinking "from the outside in", in other words implement only those behaviors which contribute most directly to these business outcomes, so as to minimize waste
* describe behaviors in a single notation which is directly accessible to domain experts, testers and developers, so as to improve communication
* apply these techniques all the way down to the lowest levels of abstraction of the software, paying particular attention to the distribution of behavior, so that evolution remains cheap
